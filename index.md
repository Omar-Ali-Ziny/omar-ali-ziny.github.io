## Projects

Here is a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

### 1. Chatbot ü§ñ

A simple chatbot application built using Python and NLP techniques. This project demonstrates how to create conversational agents that can understand and respond to user queries.

### 2. Todo List üìã

A straightforward to-do list application that helps users manage their tasks. This project uses a basic front-end framework along with a back-end API.

### 3. Weather API ‚òÄÔ∏èüåßÔ∏è

This project fetches real-time weather data from an external API. It showcases how to make API calls and handle JSON responses.

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline üõ†Ô∏è

A demonstration of a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build and deployment process. This project includes configuration files for Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

### 5. Dockerized Applications üê≥

Explore how to containerize applications using Docker. This project provides Dockerfiles and docker-compose configurations for various setups.

### 6. Kubernetes Deployments ‚ò∏Ô∏è

Learn how to deploy applications on a Kubernetes cluster. This project includes Helm charts and YAML files for setting up services.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies power the projects in this repository:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for most applications.
- **Docker**: Used for containerization.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestration of containerized applications.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques used in the chatbot project.
- **CI/CD Tools**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and other tools for automation.
- **APIs**: Integration with external services for data retrieval.

## Installation

To get started with any project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Omar-Ali-Ziny/CICDFiles.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CICDFiles/<project-name>
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. For Docker projects, build the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. For Kubernetes projects, apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary components, you can run the applications. Here‚Äôs how to do it for each project:

### Chatbot

Run the chatbot application with the following command:
```bash
python chatbot.py
```
Interact with the chatbot through the command line or a web interface, depending on the implementation.

### Todo List

Start the todo list application:
```bash
python app.py
```
Access it via your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Weather API

To run the weather API project, execute:
```bash
python weather.py
```
Make API calls to `http://localhost:5000/weather` to fetch weather data.

### CI/CD Pipeline

To trigger the CI/CD pipeline, push changes to the main branch in your GitHub repository. The pipeline will automatically run based on the configurations provided.

### Dockerized Applications

For Dockerized applications, use:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
Access the application through the specified port in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Kubernetes Deployments

Deploy your application on a Kubernetes cluster using:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
Monitor the status with:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
